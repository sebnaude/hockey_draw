# config/defaults.py
"""
Perennial default configuration.

Contains settings that carry over year to year and do NOT change between seasons.
Season-specific configs should import from here and extend as needed.

Things that belong here:
  - Field definitions (venues don't change)
  - Game times by venue/day (standard timeslots)
  - Perennial BLOCKED_GAMES (e.g., rounds 1-2 at Broadmeadow only)
  - Constraint defaults that are standing policy
  - Home field mappings
  - Grade order

Things that do NOT belong here:
  - Field unavailabilities (change every year)
  - Club days (change every year)
  - Season dates
  - Forced games
  - Team-specific blocked games
  - PHL preferences / preferred dates
